Overview
=========

tableFields are the fields composing the lines of the form.

fields are fields that will appear under the table.
You can use it either
in conjunction with a global action to eg. filter rows
or to complete data in row. Each row will be combined with fields values.

There are actions and tableActions.
Both can be used.
Actions is for the normal Actions list which will get the global form.
While if tableActions is a TableActions
actions of the collection will receive each selected row
as an individual form to process.


For table actions, the tableDataManager will get be invoked with the content
of each lines (+ global fields).
By default tableDataManager is dataManager but you may override it.

By default generate_line_form cloneFormData but you can change this behaviour,
for example to provide a specific interface.

.. TODO::
   make it a doctest
.. TODO::
   explain how line form get content as context
.. TODO::
   explain how line global errors are merged
.. TODO::
   explain that lines are regenerated after action processing upon success
   but not on failure. Explain also that ignoreRequest is set to True, upon
   success not to mix up lines.
